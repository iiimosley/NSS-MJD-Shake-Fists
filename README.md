# NSS - Modern Javascript Developer: 
## Shake Your Fist at the Sky
**(NSFW!)**

### Directives
+ Interact with [NASA's API](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#NeoWS) to pull data of astroids near Earth within a user-specified time frame
+ Compile data from NASA's API & process said data through [FOASS API](http://www.foaas.com/) to generate a derogative statement towards three selected astroids
+ Print these "sky-fist-shaking" statements to the DOM

#### Stretch Goals
+ Only give those potentially hazardous astroids a foul scorning
+ Use varying profanities provided by FOASS to add some color to your vocabulary
+ Implement [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) templating to dynamically give them a piece of your mind
